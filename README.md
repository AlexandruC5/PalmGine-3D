# Palmgine 3D is a project consistent of creating a Game Engine.
At this moment, you can import your model (.fbx and .obj), load geometry and change or apply one texture on the model (.jpg, .png, .bmp or .dds).

To work with it you must drag and drop the files on the window.

Hope you like it.
