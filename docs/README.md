# Palmgine 3D
PalmGine-3D is a game engine that has been done for the [Game Engines](https://www.upc.edu/estudispdf/guia_docent.php?codi=804246&lang=ing) subject in the 3rd year of the [Game Design and Development](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/) grade of [CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/) ([UPC](https://www.upc.edu/en?set_language=en)). It has been done in a four month period and tries to be a basic Unity like engine with one high level system.

The high level system we’ve chosen is the implementation of an audio engine called [Wwise]( https://www.audiokinetic.com/products/wwise/), so in this engine you are able to create audio listeners, audio sources and audio reverb zones to give audio to the games made with it.
